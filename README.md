Bus
This bus has a passenger entry and exit control system to monitor the number of occupants it carries and thus detect when there is too high a capacity.

At each stop the entry and exit of passengers is represented by a tuple consisting of two integer numbers.

bus_stop = (in, out)
The succession of stops is represented by a list of these tuples.

stops = [(in1, out1), (in2, out2), (in3, out3), (in4, out4)]
Goals:
lists, tuples
while/for loops
minimum, maximum, length
average, standard deviation
Tasks
Calculate the number of stops.
Assign to a variable a list whose elements are the number of passengers at each stop (in-out),
Find the maximum occupation of the bus.
Calculate the average occupation. And the standard deviation.
